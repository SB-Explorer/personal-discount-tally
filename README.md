## Introduction

### Problem Statement 

In the current retail and marketplace, buyers frequently look for quick and precise methods to compute discounts. These days, most countries have lower economic levels, particularly since the Corona era. As a result, the majority of middle-class families have begun to live on a limited budget. The discounting method in the stores helps the customer and increases production. People's lifestyles are changing as a result of the country's dire situation. As a result, they set aside the money for monthly purchases and shopping.

The entire sale shop discount calculator may not accurately represent the savings offered to individual consumers because it is really intended for commercial purchases made in large quantities. 

After making several purchases in a store, they discovered at the cashier counter that they had received a discount for some of the items purchased utilizing the wholesale shop discount calculators on the billing section. However, as they have already completed their shopping, it is already too late.

Therefore, the customers' perspective was the primary emphasis of this issue.  

### Our Solution 
 
The solution identified for the problem stated above is a personal discount tally . This personal discount tally is useful because it helps you to determine the final price of an item after applying discounts or promotions available to you as an individual consumer .
For the successive purchased products you can find a discount . As PDT allows you to make more accurate budgeting decisions based on your specific circumstances .
Therefore, the customers' perspective was the primary emphasis of this issue.

### Targeted audience 
The primarily target audience includes shoppers , online retailers and businesses looking to streamline discount calculation for their customers.
We have targeted the users that means the customers who are from middle class families.

## Methodology 

### Scopes of the project 

The scope of the project encompasses the development , testing and deployment of the personal discount tally . It includes features like 
- Can independently determine their discount and buy amount without assistance 
- Interactive , ease if accessible user interface 
- Clearly displayed output 

### Objectives 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a calculates  that accurately computes discount , total amount to be paid   offers seamless user experience and allows customization based on user preference 
- Designed to compute the final price and the appropriate amount of the discount. 
- Make the User interface  user-friendly. 
- Make the system capable of handling various discounts provided by the shop
- Guarantees the optimization of performance 
- Save and get the computation back.

### Functional Requirement

- Calculate the Discount - Using user-provided input such as product name, quantity, and original price, it precisely computes and calculates discounts. In addition, it obtains the discount percentage information from the specific shop's database or data server, where the discount percentage is updated, along with information regarding discounts and seasonal price reductions.

- Functionality specification document - Its operation, including input fields, calculation logic, and result presentation, would be thoroughly described in this paper. 
- Both front-end and back-end development with database - This comprises the PDT's codebase and the required databases.both backend and frontend was developed in C# language and MySql database. 
- User Documentation or the training material - It is a handbook or guide that explains how to use PDT and contains all kinds of materials and instructional videos. 

## Feasibility Report 
### Social Feasibility 
		
Even among the normal people , everyone is aware and wants to calculate the bill amount on their own.Even I have seen many of them calculating the net amount using the receipt given by the shop whether it is correct or not. Because every one will have an assumption whether it's a mall or a small shop they could make mistakes, wanted or unwanted. 
So most of the people desire to calculate their bills in their own way. So all of them will gladly accept the installation of this system. 
This system depicts the discount amount , so the people will be more delighted when they calculate the amount to accommodate their daily expenses or not . 


### Global Feasibility 

As marketing has become the main lead of all countries to export and import products. And as this system will not affect either  business profit  or personal economic level . This could be installed . As online businesses and retailers have become more popular , therefore , the number of  people who go to the shops and buy things has been reduced . but this system can renaissance the development of shops and malls , with further addition of components into this system this could be developed as Hybrid shops .
